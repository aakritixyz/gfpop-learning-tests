# GFPOP Test Graphs

This repository contains simple test scripts for the GFPOP R package.  
Each script creates a small GFPOP graph and saves a PNG of the plot.

## Contents

- `graph1.R` – First test graph  
- `graph2.R` – Second test graph  
- `graph3.R` – Third test graph  
- `GFPOP_results/` – PNG files of the resulting graphs

## Usage

1. Make sure `gfpop` and `igraph` are installed in R.  
2. Run any script in R or RStudio.  
3. The plot will appear and be saved automatically in `GFPOP_results/`.
